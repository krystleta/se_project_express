**Description**
  
Project 13 is a continuation with the Express project by expanding schemas to allow for authorization implementation. 

**Technologies and  techniques**  
  
Technologies and techniques used are implementing a middleware authorization and creating routes for signing up and signing in. We use JSON web tokens (JWT) and running more tests on Postman to verify authorization is working correctly.
